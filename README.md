# About_me
# Caresir Gonzales

 
I am adventurous, athletic, and very competitive! I ran track for 12 years and still hold all of the records broken from middle school, high school, city, regionals, college, and conference. I have been teaching middle school math and coaching track and basketball for 10 years. I have a bachelor's degree in psychology and a master's degree in mathematics education. 
 
 
As a teacher, I have used data to drive my instruction in class. I discovered I loved analyzing data and used it to leverage the curriculum based on the needs of my students. I also found my passion for a blended learning model with the use of technology. My experience with working with technology has given me and my students an engaging platform of infinite learning. After reevaluating my life goals, I decided that my current occupation limited my growth expectations and the salary in education will not give me the financial freedom I am searching for. I really enjoy numbers and data, which lead me to the financial industry and then I found financial and technology, and I was excited beyond words. So, I decided to amend my career goal to transition from teaching full-time into the Fintech field. On this boot camp journey, I hope to discover my new career passion.
